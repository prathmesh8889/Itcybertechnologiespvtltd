# Supabase Setup — ITCYBER (beginner-friendly)

This guide takes a brand-new Supabase project to a working production backend for **www.itcyber.in**: database + RLS, Auth, storage buckets, public Edge Functions, server-side abuse controls and the signed resume-upload flow.

Everything required is in this repository:

```text
supabase/
  migrations/
    0001_initial.sql                    # tables, RLS policies, storage buckets
    0002_lead_notes_and_scheduling.sql  # lead notes, announcement scheduling
    0003_security_hardening.sql         # profile guard + resume limits
    0004_unique_constraints.sql         # idempotent seed constraints
    0005_production_hardening.sql       # media limits, invariants, indexes
    0006_security_hardening.sql         # abuse throttling, authorship guards, signed-upload model

    submit-contact/index.ts
    submit-assessment/index.ts
    submit-career/index.ts
    prepare-resume-upload/index.ts
    deno.json
  seed.sql                              # optional starter CMS content
```

> There is no `supabase/schema.sql`. The schema lives in numbered migrations and they must be applied **in numeric order**. Once a migration has been applied to production, do not edit history to make a new schema change — create the next numbered migration instead.

---

## 1. Create the Supabase project

1. Go to Supabase → **New project**.
2. Choose a strong database password and the region closest to your users.
3. Wait for provisioning to finish.

## 2. Find the Project URL and publishable key

Dashboard → **Project Settings → API**:

- Project URL → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- publishable / anon key → `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

The publishable/anon key is designed for browser use. The **service-role key must never appear in frontend code, Vite variables, screenshots, Git, or client logs**. Supabase makes server credentials available to Edge Functions at runtime.

## 3. Apply migrations

### Option A — Supabase CLI (recommended)

```bash
npm i -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push
supabase migration list
```

`migration list` should show the same versions in Local and Remote, including `0006`.

### Option B — SQL Editor

Dashboard → **SQL Editor → New query**, then run the complete files in this exact order:

1. `supabase/migrations/0001_initial.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/0002_lead_notes_and_scheduling.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/0003_security_hardening.sql`
4. `supabase/migrations/0004_unique_constraints.sql`
5. `supabase/migrations/0005_production_hardening.sql`
6. `supabase/migrations/0006_security_hardening.sql`

Verify the Table Editor contains the expected tables including `profiles`, `services`, `ai_agents`, `automations`, `industries`, `case_studies`, `technologies`, `resources`, `jobs`, `contact_leads`, `lead_notes`, `automation_assessments`, `career_applications`, `media_library`, `seo_pages`, `legal_pages`, `announcements`, `social_links`, `admin_activity_logs`, `site_settings`, and `public_rate_limits`.

`public_rate_limits` is intentionally not readable by normal anonymous/authenticated clients. It is used by the service-role-only rate-limit function.

## 4. Load starter CMS content

Run `supabase/seed.sql` in SQL Editor after all migrations. It is designed to be repeatable where the documented unique constraints exist.

The seed intentionally leaves contact channels empty and seeds jobs unpublished/closed. Configure real contact details in Admin → Settings and publish real vacancies from Admin → Jobs.

## 5. Configure Auth

Dashboard → **Authentication → Providers → Email**:

- Keep Email enabled.
- For this private admin panel, disable public self-sign-up.
- Add staff accounts manually.

## 6. Verify Storage

Migrations create and harden:

| Bucket | Visibility | Server limits | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `site-media` | Public | 10 MB; JPG/PNG/WEBP/AVIF/MP4 | Admin-managed website media |
| `career-resumes` | Private | 5 MB; PDF/DOC/DOCX | Applicant resumes |

### Important security behavior

- Arbitrary public SVG uploads are intentionally disabled because SVG can contain active content.
- Anonymous visitors have **no direct `INSERT` policy** on `career-resumes`.
- The browser calls `prepare-resume-upload`, which validates file metadata and abuse limits server-side.
- That function generates a controlled path matching `pending/<uuid>.(pdf|doc|docx)` and returns a short-lived signed upload token.
- The browser uploads only to that signed path.
- Anonymous visitors cannot read, update or delete resumes.
- HR/admin staff open resumes through short-lived signed read URLs.

## 7. Deploy the four public Edge Functions

From the linked repository:

```bash
supabase functions deploy submit-contact --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy submit-assessment --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy submit-career --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy prepare-resume-upload --no-verify-jwt
```

The repository also contains `supabase/config.toml` with `verify_jwt = false`
for these four public endpoints, so a normal `supabase functions deploy` keeps
the same configuration. If a form shows “submission service isn't reachable”,
first confirm all four functions appear as **Active** in Dashboard → Edge
Functions, then open the function logs and check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

`--no-verify-jwt` is intentional because these endpoints are called by anonymous public visitors. They are not unauthenticated database writes: each function performs its own strict validation/origin checks and uses server-side credentials only after the request passes those controls.

Production origins built into the shared security layer include:

```text
https://www.itcyber.in
https://itcyber.in
https://itcybertechnologiespvtltd.netlify.app
```

Local development origins `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`,
`http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:5174`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`,
and `http://127.0.0.1:5174` are also built in. This
prevents the public form from failing with HTTP 403 during normal Vite testing.

For Qwen, Netlify deploy previews, or another temporary hostname, add the exact additional origin:

```bash
supabase secrets set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-preview-host.example"
```

Multiple extra origins are comma-separated. Do not use `*`.

For a new GitHub Pages, Vercel or Netlify production URL, replace the example
above with that exact `https://...` origin (no trailing slash), then redeploy the
functions. A mismatched origin is intentionally rejected with HTTP 403.

For rate-limit fingerprinting, configure a dedicated random server secret rather than putting any value in frontend environment variables:

```bash
supabase secrets set RATE_LIMIT_PEPPER="<long-random-server-only-value>"
```

Never commit `RATE_LIMIT_PEPPER` or the service-role key.

## 8. Create the first admin

Never store an admin password in code or docs.

1. Dashboard → **Authentication → Users → Add user**.
2. Enter the trusted admin email and password; auto-confirm the user.
3. The auth trigger creates the profile.
4. In SQL Editor promote that specific account:

```sql
update public.profiles
set role = 'super_admin',
    active = true
where email = 'you@itcyber.in'
returning id, email, role, active;
```

Expected: one row with `role = super_admin` and `active = true`.

Other roles are `admin`, `editor`, `sales`, and `hr`.

## 9. Configure frontend environment variables

### Local development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable-key>
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Restart Vite after environment changes.

### Netlify

Netlify → Site configuration → **Environment variables**:

```text
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable-key>
VITE_SITE_URL=https://www.itcyber.in
```

After changing a Vite variable, trigger a fresh deploy because Vite injects these values at build time.

Never create `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_RATE_LIMIT_PEPPER`, or any other frontend variable containing a server secret.

## 10. Verify RLS and privilege guards

Anonymous visitors must not be able to read leads, assessments, applications, admin logs, lead-note internals, or the rate-limit ledger, and must not be able to mutate CMS content directly.

Test through an anon/PostgREST context, not as SQL Editor database owner. Protected tables must return no protected data.

Also verify a normal authenticated user cannot self-promote:

```sql
update public.profiles set active = true where id = auth.uid();
update public.profiles set role = 'super_admin' where id = auth.uid();
update public.profiles set email = 'x@example.com' where id = auth.uid();
```

These must fail for non-super-admin users. Updating their own allowed profile fields such as `full_name` remains permitted.

Also verify:

- audit log inserts cannot claim another staff member's `user_id`;
- a sales user cannot create a lead note under another staff member's identity;
- anonymous direct inserts into `career-resumes` are rejected;
- `public_rate_limits` cannot be read or mutated by `anon` / normal `authenticated` users.

## 11. Production smoke test

After frontend deployment, migration `0006`, and all four Edge Functions are live:

1. Open `/itcyberadmin/login` and sign in with an active admin.
2. Submit the public Contact form; confirm a row in `contact_leads`.
3. Submit the assessment; confirm a row in `automation_assessments`.
4. Publish one test job with applications open.
5. Submit a small PDF/DOC/DOCX resume and confirm:
   - `prepare-resume-upload` returns successfully,
   - the private storage object is created under `pending/`,
   - a row appears in `career_applications`.
6. Close/unpublish that role and confirm `submit-career` rejects new submissions for it.
7. In Admin → Applications, confirm the resume opens through a short-lived signed URL.
8. In Admin → Media, verify SVG and oversized/disallowed files are rejected.
9. Export Leads and Applications CSVs with a test value beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`; confirm the exported value is neutralized rather than interpreted as a spreadsheet formula.
10. Test a disallowed Origin against the public Edge Functions; confirm it receives `403 Origin not allowed`.

## 12. Repository security verification

Before production releases run:

```bash
npm ci
node scripts/security-check.mjs
npm run typecheck
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=moderate
npm run build
```

GitHub CI runs the same security regression checks, production dependency audit, TypeScript build, and Deno checks for all four Edge Functions.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Admin says “Supabase is not configured” | Add Netlify/local Vite env vars and rebuild |
| Forms return 503 | Verify migration `0006`, redeploy the Edge Functions, and check server-side function secrets/logs |
| Browser shows CORS error / 403 | Add the exact trusted preview origin to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; never use `*` |
| Admin gets RLS error | Verify the profile is active and has the required role |
| Resume upload preparation rejected | PDF/DOC/DOCX only, 1 byte–5 MB, correct MIME/extension, allowed origin |
| Resume token works but upload fails | Verify `career-resumes` is private and the signed-upload flow is deployed; do not restore an anonymous INSERT policy |
| Media SVG rejected | Expected security behavior; use PNG/WEBP/AVIF/JPG or MP4 instead |
| Migration history differs | Run `supabase migration list`; do not edit already-applied historical migrations |
| CI dependency audit fails | Upgrade/remove the vulnerable production dependency; do not lower the audit threshold to hide it |

## Release rule

For every new production database change:

1. Create the next migration (`0007_...sql` after the current `0006`).
2. Open a PR.
3. Let CI run security regression checks, dependency audit, TypeScript/build, and Deno validation.
4. Apply the migration to staging/production.
5. Redeploy affected Edge Functions and frontend.
6. Run the production smoke tests above.

Do not rewrite already-applied migration files to make future schema changes.
